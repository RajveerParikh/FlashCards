# FlashCards
This is an app to simulate the process of studying using flashcards. There are two classes with a main method, and each of those classes implement a separate GUI. The user wishing to study will start from one of the "main" classes; the user wishing to create or edit a study list will start from the other. The classes containing data will be used both to edit and to study from.
